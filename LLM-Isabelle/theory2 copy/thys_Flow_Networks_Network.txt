  values from a linearly ordered integral domain, such that: 
  \begin{description}
    \item[capacity constraint] the flow on each edge is non-negative and 
      does not exceed the edge's capacity;
      the incoming flow greater or equal to the outgoing flow.
  \end{description}

text \<open>An \<open>s\<close>-\<open>t\<close> \<^emph>\<open>flow\<close> on a graph is a preflow that has no active nodes except 
  source and sink, where a node is \<^emph>\<open>active\<close> iff it has more incoming flow 
    This is called \<^emph>\<open>conservation\<close>. \<close>
  text \<open>The value of a flow is the flow that leaves $s$ and does not return.\<close>
subsubsection \<open>Cuts\<close>
text \<open>A \<^emph>\<open>cut\<close> is a partitioning of the nodes into two sets.
