Binary relations are another important model.
The weakening of some semiring axioms allows the treatment of further computation models.
The presented algebras are special cases of iterings, so many results can be inherited.

We start with left Kleene algebras, which use the left unfold and left induction axioms of Kleene algebras.

This means that for some properties of Kleene algebras, only one inequality can be derived, as exemplified by the following sliding rule.

We now show that left Kleene algebras form iterings.
A sublocale is used instead of a subclass, because iterings use a different iteration operation.

In contrast to iterings, we now obtain that the iteration operation results in least fixpoints.

We next add the right induction rule, which allows us to strengthen many inequalities of left Kleene algebras to equalities.

Again we inherit results from the itering hierarchy.

The following class contains a generalisation of Kleene algebras, which lacks the right zero axiom.

The following theorem is similar to the puzzle where persons insert themselves always in the middle between two groups of people in a line.
Here, however, items in the middle annihilate each other, leaving just one group of items behind.

We can now inherit from the strongest variant of iterings.

A Kleene algebra is obtained by requiring an idempotent semiring.

The following classes are variants of Kleene algebras expanded by an additional iteration operation.
This is useful to study the Kleene star in computation models that do not use least fixpoints in the refinement order as the semantics of recursion.

The following classes add a greatest element.

We conclude with an alternative axiomatisation of Kleene algebras.
