lemma infinity_in_MG : "infinity_ax(##M[G])"
proof -
  from infinity_ax obtain I where
    Eq1: "I\<in>M" "0 \<in> I" "\<forall>y\<in>M. y \<in> I \<longrightarrow> succ(y) \<in> I"
    unfolding infinity_ax_def  by auto
  then
  have "check(I) \<in> M"
    using check_in_M by simp
  then
  have "I\<in> M[G]"
    using valcheck generic one_in_G one_in_P GenExtI[of "check(I)" G] by simp
  have "0\<in>M[G]" using transitivity_MG by simp
  have "y \<in> M" if "y \<in> I" for y
  have "succ(y) \<in> I \<inter> M[G]" if "y \<in> I" for y
    using that Eq1 transitivity_MG by blast
