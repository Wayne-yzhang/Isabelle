	Also, part of that information is already in the routing table, so careful here... *)
(* Can I find something that looks a bit more semantic. Maybe the option monad can reduce a bit of the foo? *)
(* TODO: What happens in linux, if I send a packet to an interface with the mac of another interface? Hopefully, that is going to be dropped? *) 
(* an alternative formulation would maybe be "if the routing decision for the source is the same as for the destination, don't forward it." 
   This might be advantageous in $cases, however, this formulation is clearly easier to translate to openflow. *)
