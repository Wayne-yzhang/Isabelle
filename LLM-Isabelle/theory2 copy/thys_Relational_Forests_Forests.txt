In this theory we study orientations and various second-order specifications of undirected forests.
The results are structured by the classes in which they can be proved, which correspond to algebraic structures.
Most classes are generalisations of Kleene relation algebras.
The corresponding paper does not elaborate these fine distinctions, so some results take a different form in this theory.
