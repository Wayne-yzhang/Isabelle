In this theory we prove partial correctness of Bor\r{u}vka's minimum spanning tree algorithm.

The proof is carried out in $m$-$k$-Stone-Kleene relation algebras.
In this section we give results that hold more generally.

This is because either,
\begin{itemize}
\item there is at least one edge between $a$ and $e$, namely $x$, the edge incoming to the component that $e$ is outgoing from.
      We define $x$ in a way that we can show that the weight of $x$ is no greater than the weight of $a$ using the invariant.
      Then, it follows that the weight of $e$ is no greater than the weight of $a$ owing to transitivity.
\end{itemize}

In this section, most of the work is done to maintain the invariants of the inner and outer loops of the algorithm.

subsection \<open>Formalization and correctness proof\<close>
text \<open>
The following result shows that Bor\r{u}vka's algorithm constructs a minimum spanning forest.
We have the same postcondition as the proof of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
We show only partial correctness.
