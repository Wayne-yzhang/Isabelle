theorem n_sequences_card:
  assumes "finite A"
  shows "card (n_sequences A n) = card A ^ n"
proof -
  obtain xs where set: "set xs = A" and dis: "distinct xs"
    using assms finite_distinct_list by auto
  have "length (n_sequence_enum xs n) = (length xs) ^ n"
    using n_sequence_enum_distinct n_sequence_enum_length by auto
  then have "card (set (n_sequence_enum xs n)) = card (set xs) ^ n"
    by (simp add: dis distinct_card n_sequence_enum_distinct)
  then have "card (n_sequences (set xs) n) = card (set xs) ^ n"
    by (simp add: n_sequence_enum_correct)
  then show "card (n_sequences A n) = card A ^ n"
