This theory provides notations, basic definitions and facts of lattice-related structures used throughout the subsequent development.

subsection \<open>General Facts and Notations\<close>
text \<open>
The following results extend basic Isabelle/HOL facts.
\<close>
text \<open>
We use the following notations for the join, meet and complement operations.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Orders\<close>
text \<open>
We use the following definition of monotonicity for operations defined in classes.
We also give basic properties of Galois connections and lift orders to functions.

subsection \<open>Semilattices\<close>
text \<open>
The following are basic facts in semilattices.
\<close>
text \<open>
Every bounded semilattice is a commutative monoid.
Finite sums defined in commutative monoids are available via the following sublocale.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following class requires only the existence of upper bounds, which is a property common to bounded semilattices and (not necessarily bounded) lattices.
We use it in our development of filters.

subsection \<open>Lattices\<close>
text \<open>
Not every bounded lattice has complements, but two elements might still be complements of each other as captured in the following definition.
In this situation we can apply, for example, the shunting property shown below.
\<close>
text \<open>
Distributive lattices with a greatest element are widely used in the construction theorem for Stone algebras.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Linear Orders\<close>
text \<open>
We next consider lattices with a linear order structure.
In such lattices, join and meet are selective operations, which give the maximum and the minimum of two elements, respectively.
Moreover, the lattice is automatically distributive.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following class derives additional properties if the linear order of the lattice has a least and a greatest element.
\<close>
text \<open>
Every bounded linear order can be expanded to a bounded lattice.
Join and meet are maximum and minimum, respectively.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Non-trivial Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
Some results, such as the existence of certain filters, require that the algebras are not trivial.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Homomorphisms\<close>
text \<open>
This section gives definitions of lattice homomorphisms and isomorphisms and basic properties.
