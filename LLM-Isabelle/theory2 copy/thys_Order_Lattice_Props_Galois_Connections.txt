First, left and right adjoints of a Galois connection are defined.\<close>
text \<open>The first set of properties holds without any sort assumptions.\<close>
subsection \<open>Properties for (Pre)Orders\<close>
text \<open>The next set of properties holds in preorders or orders.\<close>
subsection \<open>Properties for Complete Lattices\<close>
text \<open>The next laws state that a function between complete lattices preserves infs 
  if and only if it has a lower adjoint.\<close>
text \<open>Once again many statements arise by duality, which Isabelle usually picks up.\<close>
