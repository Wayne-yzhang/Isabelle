text \<open>It is often needed to split a product in a single factor and the rest. Thus these two lemmas.\<close>
text \<open>This makes it very easy to show the following trivial fact.\<close>
text \<open>The finite product is consistent and closed concerning subgroups.\<close>
text \<open>It also does not matter if we exponentiate all elements taking part in the product or the
result of the product.\<close>
text \<open>Some lemmas concerning different combinations of functions in the usage of \<open>finprod\<close>.\<close>
text \<open>The subgroup generated by a set of generators (in an abelian group) is exactly the set of
elements that can be written as a finite product using only powers of these elements.\<close>
text \<open>If we switch one element from a set of generators, the generated set stays the same if both
elements can be generated from the others together with the switched element respectively.\<close>
text \<open>We can characterize a complementary family of subgroups when the only way to form the neutral
element as a product of picked elements from each subgroup is to pick the neutral element from each
subgroup.\<close>
text \<open>The finite product also distributes when nested.\<close>
text \<open>With the now proven facts, we are able to provide criterias to inductively construct a
group that is the internal direct product of a set of generators.\<close>
