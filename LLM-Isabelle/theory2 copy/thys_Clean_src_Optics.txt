     an abstract theory allowing to describe parts of memory and their 
     independence. We use it to abstractly model typed program variables and
     framing conditions. 

     Optics provides a rich framework for lense compositions and sub-lenses
     which we will not use in the context of Clean; even the offered concept
     of a list-lense, a possible means to model the stack-infrastructure 
     required for local variables, is actually richer than needed.

     Since Clean strives for minimality, we restrict ourselves to this "proxy"
     theory for Optics.
