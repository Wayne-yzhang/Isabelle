text \<open>Usually, the problem is phrased in terms of access frequencies.
We now give an interpretation of @{term wpl} in this view and show that we have actually computed
the right thing.\<close>
  \<comment> \<open>We are given a range \<open>[i..j]\<close> of integer keys with access frequencies \<open>p\<close>.
  This model assumes that the tree will contain all keys in the range \<open>[i..j]\<close>.
  See \<open>Optimal_BST\<close> for a model with missing keys.
