  In this section we develop the basic theory of abstract simplicial complexes as a collection of
  finite sets, where the power set of each member set is contained in the collection. Note that in
  this development we allow the empty simplex, since allowing it or not seemed of no logical
  consequence, but of some small practical consequence.

subsection \<open>Geometric notions\<close>

  The geometric notions attached to a simplicial complex of main interest to us are those of facets
  (subsets of codimension one), adjacency (sharing a facet in common), and chains of adjacent
  simplices.

subsection \<open>Chains of maximal simplices\<close>
text \<open>
  Chains of maximal simplices (with respect to adjacency) will allow us to walk through chamber
  complexes. But there is much we can say about them in simplicial complexes. We will call a chain
  if no maximal simplex appears more than once in the chain. (Some sources elect to call improper
  chains prechains, and reserve the name chain to describe a proper chain. And usually a slightly
  weaker notion of proper is used, requiring only that no maximal simplex appear twice in succession. But
  it essentially makes no difference, and we found it easier to use @{const distinct} rather than
  @{term "binrelchain not_equal"}.)

subsection \<open>Isomorphisms of simplicial complexes\<close>
text \<open>
  Here we develop the concept of isomorphism of simplicial complexes. Note that we have not
  bothered to first develop the concept of morphism of simplicial complexes, since every function
  on the vertex set of a simplicial complex can be considered a morphism of complexes (see lemma

subsection \<open>The complex associated to a poset\<close>
text \<open>
  A simplicial complex is naturally a poset under the subset relation. The following develops the
  reverse direction: constructing a simplicial complex from a suitable poset.
\<close>
text \<open>
  When a poset affords a simplicial complex, there is a natural morphism of posets from the
  source poset into the poset of sets in the complex, as above. However, some further assumptions
  are necessary to ensure that this morphism is an isomorphism. These conditions are collected in
  the following locale.
