This theory gives matrix models of Stone relation algebras and more general structures.
We consider only square matrices.
The main result is that matrices over Stone relation algebras form a Stone relation algebra.

We use the monoid structure underlying semilattices to provide finite sums, which are necessary for defining the composition of two matrices.
A technical difference is that those theories are mostly based on semirings whereas our hierarchy is mostly based on lattices (and our semirings directly inherit from semilattices).

Relation algebras have both a semiring and a lattice structure such that semiring addition and lattice join coincide.
In particular, finite sums and finite suprema coincide.
Isabelle/HOL has separate theories for semirings and lattices, based on separate addition and join operations and different operations for finite sums and finite suprema.
Reusing results from both theories is beneficial for relation algebras, but not always easy to realise.

subsection \<open>Finite Suprema\<close>
text \<open>
We consider finite suprema in idempotent semirings and Stone relation algebras.
For finite types, this is implemented in Isabelle/HOL as the repeated application of binary suprema.

The following induction principles are useful for comparing two suprema.
The first principle works because types are not empty.

text \<open>
Now many properties of finite suprema follow by simple applications of the above induction rules.
In particular, we show distributivity of composition, isotonicity and the upper-bound property.

In Stone relation algebras, we can also show that converse,  double complement and meet distribute over finite suprema.

subsection \<open>Square Matrices\<close>
text \<open>
Because our semiring and relation algebra type classes only work for homogeneous relations, we only look at square matrices.

We use standard matrix operations.
The Stone algebra structure is lifted componentwise.
Composition is matrix multiplication using given composition and supremum operations.
Its unit lifts given zero and one elements into an identity matrix.
Converse is matrix transpose with an additional componentwise transpose.

subsection \<open>Stone Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
We first lift the Stone algebra structure.
Because all operations are componentwise, this also works for infinite matrices.
\<close>

In particular, matrices over Stone algebras form a Stone algebra.

subsection \<open>Semirings\<close>
text \<open>
Next, we lift the semiring structure.
Because of composition, this requires a restriction to finite matrices.

subsection \<open>Stone Relation Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
Finally, we show that matrices over Stone relation algebras form a Stone relation algebra.
