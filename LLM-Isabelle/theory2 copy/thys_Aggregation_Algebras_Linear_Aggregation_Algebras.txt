Each of these instances can be used as edge weights and the resulting graphs will form s-algebras and m-algebras as shown in a separate theory.

subsection \<open>Linearly Ordered Commutative Semigroups\<close>
text \<open>
Any linearly ordered commutative semigroup extended by new least and greatest elements forms a linear aggregation lattice.
The extension is done so that the new least element is a unit of aggregation and the new greatest element is a zero of aggregation.

An example of a linearly ordered commutative semigroup is the set of real numbers with standard addition as aggregation.

Another example of a linearly ordered commutative semigroup is the set of real numbers with maximum as aggregation.

A third example of a linearly ordered commutative semigroup is the set of real numbers with minimum as aggregation.

subsection \<open>Linearly Ordered Commutative Monoids\<close>
text \<open>
Any linearly ordered commutative monoid extended by new least and greatest elements forms a linear aggregation lattice.
This is similar to linearly ordered commutative semigroups except that the aggregation $\bot + \bot$ produces the unit of the monoid instead of the least element.
Applied to weighted graphs, this means that the aggregation of the empty graph will be the unit of the monoid (for example, $0$ for real numbers under standard addition, instead of $\bot$).

If a linearly ordered commutative monoid already contains a least element which is a unit of aggregation, only a new greatest element has to be added to obtain a linear aggregation lattice.

An example of a linearly ordered commutative monoid with a least element is the set of real numbers extended by minus infinity with maximum as aggregation.

subsection \<open>Linearly Ordered Commutative Monoids with a Greatest Element\<close>
text \<open>
If a linearly ordered commutative monoid already contains a greatest element which is a unit of aggregation, only a new least element has to be added to obtain a linear aggregation lattice.

text \<open>
An example of a linearly ordered commutative monoid with a greatest element is the set of real numbers extended by infinity with minimum as aggregation.

text \<open>
Another example of a linearly ordered commutative monoid with a greatest element is the unit interval of real numbers with any triangular norm (t-norm) as aggregation.
However, this class has an addition operation, so the instantiation would require dependent types.
We therefore show only the order property in general and a particular instance of the class.

subsection \<open>Constant Aggregation\<close>
text \<open>
Any linear order with a constant element extended by new least and greatest elements forms a linear aggregation lattice where the aggregation returns the given constant.

An example of a linear order is the set of real numbers.
Any real number can be chosen as the constant.

The following instance shows that any linear order with a constant forms a linearly ordered commutative semigroup with the alpha-median operation as aggregation.
The alpha-median of two elements is the median of these elements and the given constant.

subsection \<open>Counting Aggregation\<close>
text \<open>
Any linear order extended by new least and greatest elements and a copy of the natural numbers forms a linear aggregation lattice where the aggregation counts non-$\bot$ elements using the copy of the natural numbers.
