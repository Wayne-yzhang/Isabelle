simply take the least upper bound of their \emph{guards}. This theory presents several variants on
this theme.\<close>
text\<open>The ``least upper bound'' (lob) heuristic simply disjoins the guards of two transitions with
identical outputs and updates.\<close>
text\<open>The ``greatest upper bound'' (gob) heuristic is similar to \texttt{lob} but applies a more
intellegent approach to guard merging.\<close>
text\<open>The ``Gung Ho'' heuristic simply drops the guards of both transitions, making them identical.\<close>
