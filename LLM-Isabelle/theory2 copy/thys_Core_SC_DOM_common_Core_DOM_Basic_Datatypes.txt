  In the official standard, the type @{type "USVString"} corresponds to the set of all possible   
  sequences of Unicode scalar values. As we are not interested in analyzing the specifics of Unicode
  strings, we just model @{type "USVString"} using the standard type @{type "string"} of Isabelle/HOL.

  In the official standard, the type @{type "DOMString"} corresponds to the set of all possible 
  sequences of code units, commonly interpreted as UTF-16 encoded strings. Again, as we are not 
  interested in analyzing the specifics of Unicode strings, we just model @{type "DOMString"} using 
  the standard type @{type "string"} of Isabelle/HOL.
