This command takes a protocol in the trac language as argument. The command translates this 
high-level protocol specification into a family of HOL definitions and also proves already 
a number of basic properties over these definitions. The generated definitions are all prefixed
with the name of the protocol, as given as part of the trac specification (e.g., if
@{text "keyserver"} is the protocol name given in the trac specification, then
@{text "keyserver_protocol"} will refer to the generated HOL constant that represents the transactions
of the protocol).
As an optional argument the command can take a fixed point in the trac language and generate
HOL definitions for it as well.
