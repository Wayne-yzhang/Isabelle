    indexed over a finite set and is employed in
    \ref{sec:stepwise-approach}. The definition here is much more
    intricate though. 

    An obvious advantage of this approach is that almost all
    important properties are gained without effort. The
    the Monotone Convergence Theorem in scientific literature; negative functions are also provided for via
    To be precise,
    there is exactly one important theorem missing ---
    uniqueness. That is, every function appears in at most one pair. 
    
    From uniqueness together with the introduction rules, all the
    other statements about integration, monotonicity for example,
    could be derived. On the other hand, monotonicity implies
    uniqueness. Much to my regret, none of these two could be proven.
    The proof would basically amount to a double induction to show
    that an integral gained via one rule is the same when derived by
    another. A lot of effort was spent trying to strengthen the
    induction hypothesis or reduce the goal to a simpler case. All of
    this was in vain though, and it seems that the hypothesis would
    have to be strengthened as far as to include the concept of
    integration in the first place, which in a way defeats the
    advantages of the approach.\<close>
