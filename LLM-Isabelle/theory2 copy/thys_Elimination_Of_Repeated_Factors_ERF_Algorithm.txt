Let us walk through the algorithm step by step. 
\begin{itemize}
\item A polynomial of degree $0$ is constant and thus there is nothing to do.
\item $u$ is the gcd of the monic $f$ and its derivative. 
\item $u=1$ iff $f$ is already square-free. If the characteristic is zero, this property is already 
fulfilled. Otherwise we continue and denote the (prime) characteristic by $p$. 
\item If $u\neq 1$, we split $f$ in a part $v$ and $w$. $v$ is already square-free and contains all
prime factors with exponent not divisible by $p$.
\item $w$ contains all prime factors with exponent divisible by $p$. Thus we can take the $p$-th 
and obtain $z$ (which we will further reduce in an iterative step).
