This theory develops a hierarchy of idempotent semirings.
All kinds of semiring considered here are bounded semilattices, but many lack additional properties typically assumed for semirings.
In particular, we consider the variants of semirings, in which
\begin{itemize}
\item multiplication is not required to be associative;
\item a right zero and unit of multiplication need not exist;
\item multiplication has a left residual;
\item multiplication from the left is not required to distribute over addition;
\item the semilattice order has a greatest element.
\end{itemize}
We have applied results from this theory a number of papers for unifying computation models.

The following definitions are standard for relations.
Putting them into a general class that depends only on the signature facilitates reuse.
Coreflexives are sometimes called partial identities, subidentities, monotypes or tests.

The first algebra is a very weak idempotent semiring, in which multiplication is not necessarily associative.
\<close>
text \<open>
We first show basic isotonicity and subdistributivity properties of multiplication.
\<close>
text \<open>
Next we consider under which semiring operations the above properties are closed.
\<close>

We study the following three ways of defining reflexive-transitive closures.
Each of them is given as a least prefixpoint, but the underlying functions are different.
They implement left recursion, right recursion and symmetric recursion, respectively.
\<close>
text \<open>
All functions are isotone and, therefore, if the prefixpoints exist they are also fixpoints.
\<close>
text \<open>
The fixpoint given by right recursion is always below the one given by symmetric recursion.
\<close>
text \<open>
Our next structure adds one half of the associativity property.
The converse inequality requires up-closed multirelations for Parikh's composition.
\<close>
text \<open>
For the next structure we add a left residual operation.
Such a residual is available, for example, for multirelations.

The operator notation for binary division is introduced in a class that requires a unary inverse.
This is appropriate for fields, but too strong in the present context of semirings.
We therefore reintroduce it without requiring a unary inverse.
\<close>
text \<open>
We first derive basic properties of left residuals from the Galois connection.
\<close>
text \<open>
With the help of a left residual, it follows that left recursion is below right recursion.
\<close>
text \<open>
Moreover, right recursion gives the same result as symmetric recursion.
\<close>
text \<open>
In the next structure we add full associativity of multiplication, as well as a right unit.
Still, multiplication does not need to have a right zero and does not need to distribute over addition from the left.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following result shows that for dense coreflexives there are two equivalent ways to express that a property is preserved.
In the setting of Kleene algebras, this is well known for tests, which form a Boolean subalgebra.
The point here is that only very few properties of tests are needed to show the equivalence.
\<close>
text \<open>
The next structure has both distributivity properties of multiplication.
Only a right zero is missing from full semirings.
This is important as many computation models do not have a right zero of sequential composition.
\<close>
text \<open>
This is the first structure we can connect to the semirings provided by Isabelle/HOL.
\<close>
text \<open>
Completing this part of the hierarchy, we obtain idempotent semirings by adding a right zero of multiplication.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Bounded Idempotent Semirings\<close>
text \<open>
All of the following semirings have a greatest element in the underlying semilattice order.
With this element, we can express further standard properties of relations.
We extend each class in the above hierarchy in turn.
\<close>
text \<open>
We first give basic properties of the greatest element.
\<close>
text \<open>
Closure of the above properties under the semiring operations is considered next.
\<close>
text \<open>
Some closure properties require at least half of associativity.
\<close>
text \<open>
We next consider residuals with the greatest element.
\<close>
text \<open>
Some closure properties require full associativity.
\<close>
text \<open>
Some closure properties require distributivity from the left.
\<close>
text \<open>
Our final structure is an idempotent semiring with a greatest element.
