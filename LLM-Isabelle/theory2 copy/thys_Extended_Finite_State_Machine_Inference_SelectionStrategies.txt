final model turns out. This theory file presents a number of different selection strategies.\<close>
text\<open>The simplest strategy is to assign one point for each shared pair of transitions.\<close>
text\<open>Another simple strategy is to look at the labels and arities of outgoing transitions of each
state. Pairs of states are ranked by how many transitions with the same label and arity they have in
common.\<close>
text\<open>Building off the above strategy, it makes sense to give transitions an extra ``bonus point'' if
they are exactly equal.\<close>
text\<open>Another strategy is to assign bonus points for each shared output.\<close>
text\<open>Along similar lines, we can assign additional bonus points for shared guards.\<close>
text\<open>This strategy is similar to the one above except that transitions which are exactly equal get
100 bonus points. \<close>
text\<open>We can incorporate the subsumption relation into the scoring of merges such that a pair of
states receives one point for each pair of transitions where one directly subsumes the other.\<close>
text\<open>An alternative strategy is to simply score merges based on the states' proximity to the origin.\<close>
