In this theory we characterise relation-algebraic properties of matrices over bounded linear orders (for example, extended real numbers) in terms of the entries in the matrices.
We consider, in particular, the following properties: univalent, injective, total, surjective, mapping, bijective, vector, covector, point, arc, reflexive, coreflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, asymmetric.
We also consider the effect of composition with the matrix of greatest elements and with coreflexives (tests).

Before we look at matrices, we generalise selectivity to finite suprema.

Vectors are precisely the row-constant matrices.

Hence covectors are precisely the column-constant matrices.

As usual, symmetric matrices are those which do not change under transposition.

In a transitive matrix, the weight of one of the edges on an indirect route must be below the weight of the direct edge.

We finally show the effect of composing with a coreflexive (test) from the left and from the right.
This amounts to a restriction of each row or column to the entry on the diagonal of the coreflexive.
In this case, restrictions are formed by meets.
