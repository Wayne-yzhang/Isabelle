subsection \<open> Co-dependence \<close>
text \<open> The relation states that two prisms construct disjoint elements of the source. This
  can occur, for example, when the two prisms characterise different constructors of an
  algebraic datatype. \<close>
subsection \<open> Canonical prisms \<close>
subsection \<open> Summation \<close>
text \<open> The following two lemmas are useful for reasoning about prism sums \<close>
subsection \<open> Instances \<close>
subsection \<open> Lens correspondence \<close>
text \<open> Every well-behaved prism can be represented by a partial bijective lens. We prove 
  this by exhibiting conversion functions and showing they are (almost) inverses. \<close>
text \<open> Function @{const lens_prism} is almost inverted by @{const prism_lens}. The $put$
  functions are identical, but the $get$ functions differ when applied to a source where
  the prism @{term X} is undefined. \<close>
