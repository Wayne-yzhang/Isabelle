of vertices. This allows us to represent the red part
of red-black graphs as well as the black part (i.e. LTS) using extensible records (more on this later). Edges have two 
components, @{term "src"} and @{term "tgt"}, which respectively give their source and target.\<close>
subsubsection \<open>Rooted graphs\<close>
text \<open>We model rooted graphs by the record \<open>'v rgraph\<close>. It consists of two components: its 
\<open>('v,'x) rgraph_scheme\<close>, i.e.\ an object that has at least all the components of a 
\<open>'v rgraph\<close>. The second type parameter \<open>'x\<close> stands for the hypothetical type 
parameters that such an object could have in addition of the type of vertices \<open>'v\<close>. 
Using \<open>('v,'x) rgraph_scheme\<close> instead of \<open>'v rgraph\<close> allows to reuse the following 
\<open>v2\<close> two vertices. @{term "es"} is a sub-path in @{term "g"} from @{term "v1"} to
