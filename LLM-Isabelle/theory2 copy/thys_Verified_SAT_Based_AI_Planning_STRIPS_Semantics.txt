text \<open> Analogously, a STRIPS trace either returns the singleton list containing only the given
state in case the precondition of the next operator in the plan is not satisfied. Otherwise, the
given state is prepended to trace of the rest of the plan for the successor state of executing the
next operator on the given state. \<close>

its goal state and for which all operators are elements of the problem's operator list. \<close>
