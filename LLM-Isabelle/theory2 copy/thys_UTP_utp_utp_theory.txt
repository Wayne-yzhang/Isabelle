  complete lattices and Galois connections. \<close>
subsection \<open> Complete lattice of predicates \<close>
text \<open> @{term "\<P>"} is the complete lattice of alphabetised predicates. All other theories will
  be defined relative to it. \<close>
subsection \<open> UTP theories hierarchy \<close>
text \<open> Constant @{term utp_order} obtains the order structure associated with a UTP theory.
  Its carrier is the set of healthy predicates, equality is HOL equality, and the order is
  refinement. \<close>
text \<open> The UTP order can equivalently be characterised as the fixed point lattice, @{const fpl}. \<close>
subsection \<open> UTP theory hierarchy \<close>
text \<open> We next define a hierarchy of locales that characterise different classes of UTP theory.
  Minimally we require that a UTP theory's healthiness condition is idempotent. \<close>
  text \<open> We need to remove some transitivity rules to stop them being applied in calculations \<close>
text \<open> The healthiness conditions of a UTP theory lattice form a complete lattice, and allows us to make
  retrieve lattice operators as below. \<close>
text \<open> We can then derive a number of properties about these operators, as below. \<close>
text \<open> One way of obtaining a complete lattice is showing that the healthiness conditions
  are monotone, which the below locale characterises. \<close>
text \<open> In a monotone theory, the top and bottom can always be obtained by applying the healthiness
  condition to the predicate top and bottom, respectively. \<close>
  text \<open> The UTP theory lfp operator can be rewritten to the alphabetised predicate lfp when
    in a continuous context. \<close>
text \<open> In another direction, we can also characterise UTP theories that are relational. Minimally
  this requires that the healthiness condition is closed under sequential composition. \<close>
text \<open> There also exist UTP theories with units. Not all theories have both a left and a right unit 
  (e.g. H1-H2 designs) and so we split up the locale into two cases. \<close>
text \<open> We can characterise the theory Kleene star by lifting the relational one. \<close>
text \<open> We can then characterise tests as refinements of units. \<close>
subsection \<open> Theory of relations \<close>
subsection \<open> Theory links \<close>
text \<open> We can also describe links between theories, such a Galois connections and retractions,
  using the following notation. \<close>
text \<open> Example Galois connection / retract: Existential quantification \<close>
text \<open> Any theory can be composed with an existential quantification to produce a Galois connection \<close>
