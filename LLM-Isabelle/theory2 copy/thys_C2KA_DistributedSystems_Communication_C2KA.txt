control from agent~$\Agent{A}$ to agent~$\Agent{B}$ in the system. To simplify the Isabelle theory, we do not implement 
the potential for communication using at most~$n$ basic stimuli. Instead, we give the definition of potential for direct communication 
via stimuli and the fact that~$\STIMcommD{\Agent{A}}{\Agent{B}} \Longrightarrow \STIMcomm{\Agent{A}}{\Agent{B}}$ as axioms because 
these are the only properties that we use about potential for communication via stimuli.

Communication via shared environments from agent~$\Agent{A}$ to agent~$\Agent{B}$ (denoted by~$\ENVcomm{\Agent{A}}{\Agent{B}}$) is 
said to have taken place only when~$\Agent{A}$ has the ability to alter an element of the environment that it shares with~$\Agent{B}$ 
such that~$\Agent{B}$ is able to observe the alteration that was made. Formally, we say that agent~$\agent{A}{a}$ has the 
\emph{potential for direct communication via shared environments} with agent~$\agent{B}{b}$ (denoted by~$\ENVcommD{\Agent{A}}{\Agent{B}}$) 
if and only if~$\dep{b}{a}$ where~$\depOp$ is a given dependence relation. More generally, agent~$\Agent{A}$ has the 
\emph{potential for communication via shared environments} with agent~$\Agent{B}$ (denoted by~$\ENVcomm{\Agent{A}}{\Agent{B}}$) if and 
only if~$\depTC{b}{a}$ where~$\depOpTC$ is the transitive closure of the given dependence relation. This means that if two agents respect 
the given dependence relation, then there is a potential for communication via shared environments.

Two subsets~$X_1$ and~$X_2$ of~$\A$ form a partition of~$\A$ if and only if~$X_1 \cap X_2 = \STbot$ and~$X_1 \cup X_2 = \A$. A distributed system 
of agents~$\A$ is called \emph{stimuli-connected} if and only if for every~$X_1$ and~$X_2$ nonempty that form a partition of~$\A$, we 
have~$\lnotation{\exists}{\Agent{A},\Agent{B}}{\Agent{A} \in X_1 \nAnd \Agent{B} \in X_2}{\STIMcomm{\Agent{A}}{\Agent{B}} \Ors \STIMcomm{\Agent{B}}{\Agent{A}}}$. 
Otherwise,~$\A$ is called \emph{stimuli-disconnected}. In a stimuli-connected system, every agent is a participant, either as the source or sink, 
of at least one direct communication via stimuli.

An agent~$\Agent{A} \in \A$ is called \emph{universally influential} if and only 
if~$\biglnotation{\forall}{\Agent{B}}{\Agent{B} \in \A \STdiff \set{\Agent{A}}}{\STIMcomm{\Agent{A}}{\Agent{B}}}$. 
A universally influential agent is able to generate some stimuli that influences the behaviour, either directly or 
indirectly, of each other agent in the system.

subsubsection \<open>Potential for Communication via Stimuli \label{ssub:pfc_stim}\<close>
text \<open>
The following results show how the potential for communication via stimuli can be preserved when non-determinism is introduced among agents. 
Specifically, Lemma \emph{source-nondet-stimcomm} states that when non-determinism is added at the source of a potential communication path via stimuli, the potential 
for communication via stimuli is always preserved. On the other hand, Lemma \emph{sink-nondet-stimcomm} states that when non-determinism is added at the sink of a 
potential communication path via stimuli, the potential for communication is preserved only if there does not exist any basic stimulus that is 
generated by the source that influences agent~$\Agent{B}$ and agent~$\Agent{C}$ to behave as a sub-behaviour of agent~$\Agent{B + C}$. This 
condition ensures that agent~$\Agent{B + C}$ cannot have a fixed point behaviour.

Lemmas \emph{source-nondet-envcomm} and \emph{sink-nondet-envcomm} show how the potential for communication via shared environments is preserved when non-determinism is 
introduced at the source or the sink of a potential communication path via shared environments.

subsection \<open>Preserving the Potential for Communication with Agent Behaviour Modifications\label{sub:preservation}\<close>
text \<open>
The following results identify the conditions constraining the modifications that can be made to the source or sink agent involved in a direct potential for communication to 
preserve the communication in a distributed system. In this way, it demonstrates the conditions under which a modification to an agent behaviour can be made while maintaining 
the communicating behaviour of the agents in the system.

Specifically, Lemma \emph{sink-seq-stimcomm} shows how the sequential composition of an additional behaviour on the left of a sink agent will not affect the potential for communication 
provided that every stimulus that is generated by the source agent either does not fix the behaviour of the first component of the sequential composition, or causes the 
first component of the sequential composition to generate a stimulus that does not fix the behaviour of the second component of the sequential composition. Alternatively, 
Lemma \emph{nondet-right-source-communication} shows how non-determinism added on the right of a source agent will not affect the potential for communication provided that 
the non-deterministic behaviours can be influenced by the source agent to stop being a sub-behaviour of the non-deterministic behaviour.
