the network.

For this purpose, we have strengthened the observation power of the security property for
transitions that contribute to the state of the trigger (see the observation setup
theories).  This guarantees that the confidentiality of one post is independent of actions
affecting other posts, which will allow us to combine security guarantees for different posts.

We now prove a few helper lemmas establishing that now the observable transitions indeed
fully determine the state of the trigger.\<close>
text \<open>We are now ready to combine two confidentiality properties for different posts in different
nodes.\<close>
text \<open>The combined observations consist of the local actions of observing users and their outputs,
as usual. We do not consider communication actions here for simplicity, because this would require
tedious.\<close>
text \<open>We now instantiate the generic technique for combining security properties with
independent secret sources.\<close>
