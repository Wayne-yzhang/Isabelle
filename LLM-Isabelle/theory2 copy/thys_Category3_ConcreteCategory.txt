  composition and rebuilding it as a concrete category.
  We note, however, that we do not assume that the composition function given as parameter
  to the concrete category construction is ``extensional'', so in general it will contain
  incidental information about composition of non-composable arrows, and this information
  is not preserved by the concrete category construction.

      The next few results show that domains, codomains, and composition in the constructed
      category are as expected according to the just-given correspondence.
