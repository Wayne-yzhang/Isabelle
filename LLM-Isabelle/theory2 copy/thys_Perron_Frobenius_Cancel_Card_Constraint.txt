lemma n_zero_nonempty: "n \<noteq> 0 \<Longrightarrow> {0 ..< n :: nat} \<noteq> {}" by auto

lemma type_impl_card_n: assumes "\<exists>(Rep :: 'a \<Rightarrow> nat) Abs. type_definition Rep Abs {0 ..< n :: nat}"
  shows "class.finite (TYPE('a)) \<and> CARD('a) = n"
proof -
  from assms obtain rep :: "'a \<Rightarrow> nat" and abs :: "nat \<Rightarrow> 'a" where t: "type_definition rep abs {0 ..< n}" by auto
  have "card (UNIV :: 'a set) = card {0 ..< n}" using t by (rule type_definition.card)
  also have "\<dots> = n" by auto
  finally have bn: "CARD ('a) = n" .
  have "finite (abs ` {0 ..< n})" by auto
  also have "abs ` {0 ..< n} = UNIV" using t by (rule type_definition.Abs_image)
  finally have "class.finite (TYPE('a))" unfolding class.finite_def .
