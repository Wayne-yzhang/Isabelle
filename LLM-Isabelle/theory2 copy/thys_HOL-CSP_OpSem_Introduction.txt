      the work of Hoare and Roscoe on the denotational semantics of the 
      Failure/Divergence Model of CSP. It follows essentially the presentation of CSP 
      and the semantic details in a joint paper of Roscoe and Brooks

      several classic CSP operators and number of ``laws'' (i.e. derived equations)
      that govern their interactions.

text \<open>The present work addresses the problem of operational semantics for CSP which are the
      foundations for finite model-checking and process simulation techniques.
      In the literature, there are a few versions of operational semantics for CSP,
      which lend themselves to the constructions of labelled transition systems (LTS).
      Of course, denotational and operational constructs are expected to coincide, 
      but this is not obvious at first glance.
      in terms of the denotational semantics and derive the expected laws for
      operational semantics from these.\<close>
