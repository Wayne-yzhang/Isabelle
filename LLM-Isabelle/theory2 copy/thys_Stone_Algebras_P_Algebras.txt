This theory expands lattices with a pseudocomplement operation.
In particular, we consider the following algebraic structures:
\begin{itemize}
\item pseudocomplemented lattices (p-algebras)
\item pseudocomplemented distributive lattices (distributive p-algebras)
\item Stone algebras
\item Heyting semilattices
\item Heyting lattices
\item Heyting algebras
\item Heyting-Stone algebras
\item Brouwer algebras
\item Boolean algebras
\end{itemize}

In this section we add a pseudocomplement operation to lattices and to distributive lattices.

subsubsection \<open>Pseudocomplemented Lattices\<close>
text \<open>
\<close>
text \<open>
Regular elements and dense elements are frequently used in pseudocomplemented algebras.
\<close>
text \<open>
The pseudocomplement satisfies the following half of the requirements of a complement.
\<close>
text \<open>
The double complement is a closure operation.
\<close>
text \<open>
One of De Morgan's laws holds in pseudocomplemented lattices.
\<close>
text \<open>
Weak forms of the shunting property hold.
Most require a pseudocomplemented element on the right-hand side.
\<close>
text \<open>
Pseudocomplements are unique.
\<close>
text \<open>
Conjugates are usually studied for Boolean algebras, however, some of their properties generalise to pseudocomplemented algebras.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following class gives equational axioms for the pseudocomplement operation.
\<close>
subsubsection \<open>Pseudocomplemented Distributive Lattices\<close>
text \<open>
We obtain further properties if we assume that the lattice operations are distributive.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Stone Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
A Stone algebra is a distributive lattice with a pseudocomplement that satisfies the following equation.
We thus obtain the other half of the requirements of a complement at least for the regular elements.
\<close>
text \<open>
As a consequence, we obtain both De Morgan's laws for all elements.
\<close>
text \<open>
The regular elements are precisely the ones having a complement.
\<close>
text \<open>
\<close>
text \<open>
Every bounded linear order can be expanded to a Stone algebra.
\<close>
text \<open>
The regular elements are the least and greatest elements.
All elements except the least element are dense.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Heyting Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
In this section we add a relative pseudocomplement operation to semilattices and to lattices.
\<close>
subsubsection \<open>Heyting Semilattices\<close>
text \<open>
This can be stated as a Galois connection.
Many properties can already be shown if the underlying structure is just a semilattice.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following class gives equational axioms for the relative pseudocomplement operation (inequalities can be written as equations).
\<close>
text \<open>
The following class allows us to explicitly give the pseudocomplement of an element relative to itself.
\<close>
subsubsection \<open>Heyting Lattices\<close>
text \<open>
We obtain further properties if the underlying structure is a lattice.
In particular, the lattice operations are automatically distributive in this case.
\<close>
subsubsection \<open>Heyting Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
The pseudocomplement operation can be defined in Heyting algebras, but it is typically not part of their signature.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following class gives equational axioms for Heyting algebras.
\<close>
text \<open>
A relative pseudocomplement is not enough to obtain the Stone equation, so we add it in the following class.
\<close>
subsubsection \<open>Brouwer Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
Brouwer algebras are dual to Heyting algebras.
We can now use the binary operation provided by Boolean algebras in Isabelle/HOL because it is compatible with dual relative pseudocomplements (not relative pseudocomplements).
\<close>
subsection \<open>Boolean Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
This section integrates Boolean algebras in the above hierarchy.
In particular, we strengthen several results shown above.
\<close>
text \<open>
Every Boolean algebra is a Stone algebra, a Heyting algebra and a Brouwer algebra.
