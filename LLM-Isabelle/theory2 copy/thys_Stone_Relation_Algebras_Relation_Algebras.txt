The main structures introduced in this theory are Stone relation algebras.
Our motivation is to generalise relation-algebraic methods from unweighted graphs to weighted graphs.
Unlike unweighted graphs, weighted graphs do not form a Boolean algebra because there is no complement operation on the edge weights.
However, edge weights form a Stone algebra, and matrices over edge weights (that is, weighted graphs) form a Stone relation algebra.

Our main application there is the verification of Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
In particular, Stone relation algebras do not assume that the underlying lattice is complete or a Heyting algebra, and they do not assume that composition has residuals.

We proceed in two steps.
Second, we extend these structures by a pseudocomplement operation with additional axioms to obtain Stone relation algebras.

Tarski's relation algebras are then obtained by a simple extension that imposes a Boolean algebra.

subsection \<open>Single-Object Bounded Distributive Allegories\<close>
text \<open>
We start with developing bounded distributive allegories.
The following definitions concern properties of relations that require converse in addition to lattice and semiring operations.
\<close>
text \<open>
The main change is that only a bounded distributive lattice is required, not a Boolean algebra.
\<close>
text \<open>
Many properties of relation algebras already follow in bounded distributive allegories.
\<close>
text \<open>
We still obtain a semiring structure.
\<close>
text \<open>
The intersection with a vector can still be exported from the first argument of a composition, and many other properties of vectors and covectors continue to hold.
\<close>
text \<open>
We still have two ways to represent surjectivity and totality.
\<close>
text \<open>
We continue with studying further closure properties.
\<close>
text \<open>
We show a fact about equivalences.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following result generalises the fact that composition with a test amounts to intersection with the corresponding vector.
Both tests and vectors can be used to represent sets as relations.
\<close>
text \<open>
Also the equational version of the Dedekind rule continues to hold.

It is used to show that the while-loop preserves injectivity of the constructed tree.
\<close>
text \<open>
Well-known distributivity properties of univalent and injective relations over meet continue to hold.
\<close>
text \<open>
The shunting properties for bijective relations and mappings continue to hold.

subsection \<open>Single-Object Pseudocomplemented Distributive Allegories\<close>
text \<open>
We extend single-object bounded distributive allegories by a pseudocomplement operation.
The following definitions concern properties of relations that require a pseudocomplement.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following variants are useful for the graph model.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following so-called Schr\"oder equivalences, or De Morgan's Theorem K, hold only with a pseudocomplemented element on both right-hand sides.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following result looks similar to a property of (anti)domain.
\<close>
text \<open>
Even in Stone relation algebras, we do not obtain the backward implication in the following result.
\<close>
text \<open>
We show a number of facts about equivalences.
\<close>
text \<open>
The pseudocomplement of tests is given by the following operation.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following operation represents states with infinite executions of non-strict computations.
\<close>
text \<open>
Many of the following results have been derived for verifying Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following result is used to show that the while-loop of Prim's algorithm preserves that the constructed tree is a subgraph of g.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following result shows how to apply the Schr\"oder equivalence to the middle factor in a composition of three relations.
Again the elements on the right-hand side need to be pseudocomplemented.
\<close>
text \<open>
The rotation versions of the Schr\"oder equivalences continue to hold, again with pseudocomplemented elements on the right-hand side.
\<close>
text \<open>
Composition commutes, relative to the diversity relation.
\<close>
text \<open>
Bijective relations and mappings can be exported from a pseudocomplement.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following facts are used in the correctness proof of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Stone Relation Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
The main change is that only a Stone algebra is required, not a Boolean algebra.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following property is a simple consequence of the Stone axiom.
We cannot hope to remove the double complement in it.
\<close>
text \<open>
The following variants of total and surjective are useful for graphs.
\<close>
text \<open>
Bijective elements and mappings are necessarily regular, that is, invariant under double-complement.
This implies that points are regular.
Moreover, also arcs are regular.
\<close>
text \<open>
Every Stone algebra can be expanded to a Stone relation algebra by identifying the semiring and lattice structures and taking identity as converse.
\<close>
text \<open>
Every bounded linear order can be expanded to a Stone algebra, which can be expanded to a Stone relation algebra by reusing some of the operations.
\<close>
subsection \<open>Relation Algebras\<close>
text \<open>
For a relation algebra, we only require that the underlying lattice is a Boolean algebra.
In fact, the only missing axiom is that double-complement is the identity.
\<close>
text \<open>
We now obtain the original formulations of the Schr\"oder equivalences.
\<close>
text \<open>
We briefly look at the so-called Tarski rule.
In some models of Stone relation algebras it only holds for regular elements, so we add this as an assumption.
\<close>
text \<open>
We can then show, for example, that every arc is contained in a pseudocomplemented relation or its pseudocomplement.
\<close>
text \<open>The next three lemmas \<open>arc_in_arc_or_complement\<close>, \<open>arc_in_sup_arc\<close> and \<open>different_arc_in_sup_arc\<close> were contributed by Nicolas Robinson-O'Brien.\<close>
text \<open>
Finally, the above axioms of relation algebras do not imply that they contain at least two elements.
This is necessary, for example, to show that arcs are not empty.
