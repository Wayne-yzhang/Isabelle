text\<open>\noindent{With actualist quantification in place we can:
(i) formalize the concept of existence in the usual form (by using a restricted particular quantifier),
(ii) formalize necessariness as existing necessarily, and
(iii) formalize contingency as existing possibly but not necessarily.
}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{Note that we have just chosen our logic for formalization: a free quantified modal logic \emph{K}
with positive semantics.
The logic is \emph{free} because the domain of quantification (for actualist quantifiers) is a proper subset of
our universe of discourse, so we can refer to non-actual objects. The semantics is \emph{positive} because
we have placed no restriction regarding predication on non-actual objects, so they are also allowed
to exemplify properties and relations.
We are also in a position to embed stronger normal modal logics (\emph{KB, KB5, S4, S5, ...})
by restricting the accessibility relation \emph{R} with additional axioms.}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{Having chosen our logic, we can now turn to the formalization of the concepts of abstractness and concreteness.
As seen previously, Lowe has already provided us with an explication of these concepts:}\<close> 
text\<open>\noindent{(D3) \emph{x is a concrete being := x exists in space and time, or at least in time.}}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{(D4) \emph{x is an abstract being := x does not exist in space or time.}}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{Lowe himself acknowledges that the explication of these concepts in terms of existence
"in space and time" is superfluous, since we are only interested in them being complementary.\footnote{
We quote from Lowe's original article:
"Observe that, according to these definitions, a being cannot be both concrete and abstract:
being concrete and being abstract are mutually exclusive properties of beings.
Also, all beings are either concrete or abstract ... the abstract/concrete distinction is exhaustive.
Consequently, a being is concrete if and only if it is not abstract."}
Thus we start by formalizing concreteness as a \emph{primitive} world-dependent predicate and then derive
abstractness from it, namely as its negation.
}\<close>  
text\<open>\noindent{We can now formalize the definition of Godlikeness (P1) as follows: }\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{We also formalize premise P2 ("Some necessary abstract beings exist") as shown below:}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{Let's now turn to premises P3 ("All abstract beings are dependent beings") and P4
("All dependent beings depend for their existence on independent beings").
We have here three new concepts to be explicated: two predicates "dependent" and "independent"
and a relation "depends (for its existence) on", which has been called
\emph{ontological dependence} by Lowe.
Following our linguistic intuitions concerning their interrelation, we start by proposing
the following formalization:}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{We have formalized ontological dependence as a \emph{primitive} world-dependent relation
and refrained from any explication (as suggested by Lowe).\footnote{
An explication of this concept has been suggested by Lowe in definition D5
("x depends for its existence on y := necessarily, x exists only if y exists").
Concerning this alleged definition, he has written in a footnote to the same article:
"Note, however, that the two definitions (D5) and (D6) presented below are not in fact formally called upon in the
version of the ontological argument that I am now developing, so that in the remainder of
this chapter the notion of existential dependence may, for all intents and purposes, be taken
as primitive. There is an advantage in this, inasmuch as finding a perfectly apt definition of
existential dependence is no easy task, as I explain in `Ontological Dependence.'"
Lowe refers hereby to his article on ontological dependence in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

We have called an entity \emph{dependent} if and only if there \emph{actually exists} an object y such that
x \emph{depends for its existence} on it;
accordingly, we have called an entity \emph{independent} if and only if it is not dependent.}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{As a consequence, premises P3 ("All abstract beings are dependent beings") and P4
("All dependent beings depend for their existence on independent beings") become formalized as follows.}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{Concerning premises P5 ("No contingent being can explain the existence of a necessary being") and
P6 ("The existence of any dependent being needs to be explained"), a suitable formalization
for expressions of the form: "the entity X explains the existence of Y" and
"the existence of X is explained" needs to be found.
These expressions rely on a single binary relation, which will initially be taken as \emph{primitive}.
This relation has been called \emph{metaphysical explanation} by Lowe.}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{Premise P6, together with the last two premises: P7
("Dependent beings of any kind cannot explain their own existence") and
P8 ("The existence of dependent beings can only be explained by beings on which they depend for their existence"),
were introduced by Lowe in order to relate the concept of \emph{metaphysical explanation}
to \emph{ontological dependence}.\footnote{Note that we use non-guarded quantifiers for the formalization of
the last three premises in order to test argument's validity under the strongest assumptions.
As before, we turn a blind eye to modal expressions like "can", "needs to", etc.}}\<close>  
text\<open>\noindent{Although the last three premises seem to couple very tightly the concepts of (metaphysical) explanation
and (ontological) dependence, both concepts are not meant by Lowe to be equivalent.\footnote{
Lowe says: "Existence-explanation is not simply the inverse of existential dependence.
If x depends for its existence on y, this only means that x cannot exist without y
existing. This is not at all the same as saying that x exists because y exists, or that
x exists in virtue of the fact that y exists."}
We have used Nitpick in order to test this claim. Since a countermodel has been found, we have proven
that the (inverse) equivalence of metaphysical explanation and ontological dependence
is not implied by the axioms.}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{For any being, however, having its existence "explained"
is equivalent to its existence being "dependent" (on some other being).
This follows already from premises P6 and P8, as shown above by Isabelle's prover.}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{The Nitpick model finder is also useful to check axioms' consistency at any stage during the
formalization of an argument.
We instruct Nitpick to generate a model satisfying some tautological sentence
(here we use a trivial `True' proposition) while taking into account all previously defined axioms.}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{In this case, Nitpick was able to find a model satisfying the given tautology; this means that
all axioms defined so far are consistent. The model found has a cardinality of two for the set of
individual objects and a single world.}\<close>
text\<open>\noindent{We can also use model finders to perform `sanity checks'. We can instruct Nitpick
to find a countermodel for some specifically tailored formula which we want to make sure is not valid.
We check below, for instance, that our axioms are not too strong as to imply \emph{metaphysical necessitism}
(i.e. all beings necessarily exist)
or \emph{modal collapse}. Since both would trivially validate the argument.}\<close>
