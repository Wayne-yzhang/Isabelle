This theory develops a fixpoint calculus based on partial orders.
Besides fixpoints we consider least prefixpoints and greatest postfixpoints of functions on a partial order.
We do not assume that the underlying structure is complete or that all functions are continuous or isotone.
Assumptions about the existence of fixpoints and necessary properties of the involved functions will be stated explicitly in each theorem.
This way, the results can be instantiated by various structures, such as complete lattices and Kleene algebras, which impose different kinds of restriction.
Our fixpoint calculus contains similar rules, in particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item unfold rule,
\item fixpoint operators preserve isotonicity,
\item square rule,
\item rolling rule,
\item various fusion rules,
\item exchange rule and
\item diagonal rule.
\end{itemize}
All of our rules are based on existence rather than completeness of the underlying structure.

The whole calculus is based on partial orders only.

We first define when an element $x$ is a least/greatest (pre/post)fixpoint of a given function $f$.
\<close>

Next follows the existence of the corresponding fixpoints for a given function $f$.

The actual least/greatest (pre/post)fixpoints of a given function $f$ are extracted by the following operators.
\<close>
text \<open>
We start with basic consequences of the above definitions.

Next come the unfold rules for least/greatest (pre/post)fixpoints.
\<close>
text \<open>
Pre-/postfixpoints of isotone functions are fixpoints.
\<close>
text \<open>
The fixpoint operators preserve isotonicity.
\<close>
text \<open>
The square rule for fixpoints of a function applied twice.
\<close>
text \<open>
The rolling rule for fixpoints of the composition of two functions.
\<close>
text \<open>
Least (pre)fixpoints are below greatest (post)fixpoints.
\<close>
text \<open>
Several variants of the fusion rule for fixpoints follow.
\<close>
text \<open>
Next come the exchange rules for replacing the first/second function in a composition.

The converse of the preceding result is claimed for continuous $f$, $g$ on a complete partial order; it is unknown whether it holds without these additional assumptions.

Finally, we show a number of versions of the diagonal rule for functions with two arguments.
