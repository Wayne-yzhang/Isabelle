this theory is based on and applications \<close>
subsection \<open>Vec Space Extensions\<close>
text \<open>Simple extensions to the existing vector space locale on linear independence \<close>
text \<open>While a trivial definition, this enables us to directly reference the definition outside
of a locale context, as @{term "lin_indpt"} is an inherited definition \<close>
subsection \<open>Linear Bound Argument Lemmas\<close>
text \<open>Three general representations of the linear bound argument, requiring a direct fact of 
linear independence onthe rows of the vector space over either a set A of vectors, list xs of vectors
or a Matrix' columns \<close>
text\<open>The linear bound argument lemma on a matrix requiring the lower level assumption on a linear
combination. This removes the need to directly refer to any aspect of the linear algebra libraries \<close>
text \<open>A further extension to present the linear combination directly as a sum. This manipulation from 
vector product to a summation was found to commonly be repeated in proofs applying this rule \<close>
