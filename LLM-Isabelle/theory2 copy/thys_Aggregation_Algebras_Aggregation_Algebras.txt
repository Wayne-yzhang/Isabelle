This theory gives algebras with operations for aggregation and minimisation.
In the weighted-graph model of matrices over (extended) numbers, the operations have the following meaning.
The binary operation $+$ adds the weights of corresponding edges of two graphs.
Addition does not have to be the standard addition on numbers, but can be any aggregation satisfying certain basic properties as demonstrated by various models of the algebras in another theory.
The result is a single aggregated weight using the same aggregation as $+$ but applied internally to the edges of a single graph.
It yields the position of such an edge as a regular element of a Stone relation algebra.

We give axioms for these operations which are sufficient to prove the correctness of Prim's and Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithms.
