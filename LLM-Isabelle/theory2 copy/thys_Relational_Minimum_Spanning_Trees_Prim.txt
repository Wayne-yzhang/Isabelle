In this theory we prove total correctness of Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.

We first show three verification conditions which are used in both correctness proofs.

The following result shows that Prim's algorithm terminates and constructs a spanning tree.
We cannot yet show that this is a minimum spanning tree.

Because we have shown total correctness, we conclude that a spanning tree exists.

This implies that a minimum spanning tree exists, which is used in the subsequent correctness proof.

Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm terminates and is correct.
This is the same algorithm that is used in the previous correctness proof, with the same precondition and variant, but with a different invariant and postcondition.
