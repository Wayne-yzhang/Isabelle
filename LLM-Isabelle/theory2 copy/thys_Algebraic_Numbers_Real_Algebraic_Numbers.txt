  theory adds the numeric computations that are required to separate the roots, and to
  pick unique representatives of algebraic numbers. 

  The development is split into three major parts. First, an ambiguous representation of 
  algebraic numbers is used, afterwards another layer is used with special treatment of rational numbers
  which still does not admit unique representatives, and finally, a quotient type is created modulo 
  the equivalence.
  
  The theory also contains a code-setup to implement real numbers via real algebraic numbers.\<close>
