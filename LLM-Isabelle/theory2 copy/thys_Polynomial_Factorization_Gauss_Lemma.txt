  In contrast to the theory on unique factorization domains -- where Gauss Lemma is also proven 
   in a more generic setting --
  we are here in an executable setting and do not use the unspecified $some-gcd$ function.
  Moreover, there is a slight difference in the definition of content: in this theory it is only
  defined for integer-polynomials, whereas in the UFD theory, the content is defined for 
  polynomials in the fraction field.\<close>
