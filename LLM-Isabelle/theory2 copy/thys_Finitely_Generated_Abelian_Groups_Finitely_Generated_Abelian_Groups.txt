However, the proof is not done in the context of a finitely generated group but for a finitely

text \<open>As every group is a subgroup of itself, the theorem follows directly. However, for reasons of
convenience and uniqueness (although not completely proved), we strengthen the result by proving
that the decomposition can be done without having the trivial factor in the product.
We formulate the theorem in various ways: firstly, the invariant factor decomposition.\<close>
