  This follows CryptoMiniSAT's CNF-XOR formula syntax.
  A clause is a list of literals (one of which must be satisfied).
  An XOR constraint has the form $l_1 + l_2 + \dots + l_n = 1$ where addition is taken over $F_2$.
  Syntactically, they are specified by the list of LHS literals.
  Variables are natural numbers (in practice, variable 0 is never used)

  This formalizes the usual linear conversion from CNF-XOR into CNF.
  It is not necessary to use this conversion for solvers that support
  CNF-XOR formulas natively.
