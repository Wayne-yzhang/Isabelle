This theory develops filters based on orders, semilattices, lattices and distributive lattices.
We prove the ultrafilter lemma for orders with a least element.
We show the following structure theorems:
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of filters over a directed semilattice forms a lattice with a greatest element.
\item The set of filters over a bounded semilattice forms a bounded lattice.
\item The set of filters over a distributive lattice with a greatest element forms a bounded distributive lattice.
\end{itemize}
Another result is that in a distributive lattice ultrafilters are prime filters.
We also prove a lemma of Gr\"atzer and Schmidt about principal filters.

We apply these results in proving the construction theorem for Stone algebras (described in a separate theory).

This section gives the basic definitions related to filters in terms of orders.
The main result is the ultrafilter lemma.

The existence of proper filters and ultrafilters requires that the underlying order contains at least two elements.

subsection \<open>Lattices\<close>

This section develops the lattice structure of filters based on a semilattice structure of the underlying order.
The main results are that filters over a directed semilattice form a lattice with a greatest element and that filters over a bounded semilattice form a bounded lattice.

For convenience, the following function injects principal filters into the filter type.

The following definition applies a function to each element of a filter.
The subsequent lemma gives conditions under which the result of this application is a filter.

subsection \<open>Distributive Lattices\<close>

In this section we additionally assume that the underlying order forms a distributive lattice.
Then filters form a bounded distributive lattice if the underlying order has a greatest element.
Moreover ultrafilters are prime filters.
We also prove a lemma of Gr\"atzer and Schmidt about principal filters.
